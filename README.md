## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.18+** installed on your system
- Backend services to load balance (for testing)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rixtrayker/go-loadbalancer.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd go-loadbalancer

# Build the project
go build -o go-lb .
```

### Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file with your configuration:

```yaml
server:
  address: ":8080"
  
backend_pools:
  - name: "web-servers"
    algorithm: "round_robin"
    backends:
      - url: "http://localhost:3001"
        weight: 1
      - url: "http://localhost:3002"
        weight: 2
    health_check:
      path: "/health"
      interval: "30s"
      timeout: "5s"

routing_rules:
  - match:
      host: "example.com"
      path: "/api/*"
    target_pool: "web-servers"
    policies:
      - rate_limit: "100/minute"
```

### Running

```bash
# Start with default configuration
./go-lb

# Or specify a config file
./go-lb --config config.yaml
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The load balancer uses a flexible configuration system supporting:

- **🎯 Listener Settings**: Address, port, TLS configuration
- **🏊 Backend Pools**: Server groups with load balancing algorithms
- **💓 Health Checks**: Monitoring intervals, timeouts, and probe types
- **🛣️ Routing Rules**: Complex request matching and forwarding
- **📋 Policies**: Rate limiting, transformations, and access control

### Configuration Sources

- YAML files
- Environment variables
- Command-line flags
- Runtime API updates

For detailed configuration options, see the [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md).
