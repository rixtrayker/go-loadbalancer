# Go Load Balancer Architecture

## Overview

The Go Load Balancer is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind. This document outlines the high-level architecture and component interactions.

## Core Components

### Application (cmd/go-lb)

The entry point for the load balancer application. It initializes all components and starts the HTTP server.

### Configuration (configs)

Handles loading and parsing of configuration from files, environment variables, and command-line flags.

### HTTP Handler (internal/handler)

Processes incoming HTTP requests, applies routing rules, and forwards requests to the appropriate backend.

### Backend Management (internal/backend)

Manages backend server information and connection details.

### Server Pool (internal/serverpool)

Organizes backends into pools and implements load balancing algorithms.

### Health Checking (internal/healthcheck)

Monitors backend health and updates server availability status.

### Routing (internal/routing)

Implements request routing based on configurable rules.

### Policy Enforcement (internal/policy)

Applies policies like rate limiting, header transformation, and access control.

### Admin Interface (internal/admin)

Provides runtime configuration and monitoring capabilities.

## Data Flow

1. An HTTP request arrives at the load balancer
2. The HTTP handler processes the request
3. Routing rules determine which backend pool should handle the request
4. Policies are applied to the request (rate limiting, transformations, etc.)
5. The server pool selects a backend using the configured algorithm
6. The request is forwarded to the selected backend
7. The response is returned to the client

## Extension Points

The architecture is designed to be extensible in several ways:

- **Load Balancing Algorithms**: New algorithms can be added by implementing the Algorithm interface
- **Health Check Probes**: Additional health check types can be added
- **Routing Rules**: The routing engine can be extended with new matching criteria
- **Policies**: New policy types can be implemented and integrated
- **Metrics and Monitoring**: Additional observability integrations can be added
