## Project Overview

The Go Load Balancer is a high-performance, feature-rich HTTP/S load balancer built from scratch in Go. It is designed to be both an educational resource and a practical networking infrastructure component, demonstrating core concepts of distributed systems, load balancing, and network programming.

### Key Features

- **Multiple Load Balancing Algorithms**: Round Robin, Least Connections, Weighted
- **Health Monitoring**: Active health checks with automatic failover
- **Advanced Routing**: Host, path, method, and header-based routing
- **Policy Enforcement**: Rate limiting, IP access control, header transformation
- **Observability**: Logging, metrics, and tracing integration
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend and customize
